If the token is a linked token, the hotbar will be linked to the actor by default.</p><br><h4>Updates</h4><p>🎲 Token hotbars can now be shared. That is, any player that select the token will see the same token hotbar.<br>🎲 Shared token hotbars can be locked, meaning only GMs can edit them.<br> 🐛 Hotbar is not cleared when no tokens are controlled. Previous active hotbar is now shown.<br></p>",
